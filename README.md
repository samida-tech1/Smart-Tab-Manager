# Smart-Tab-Manager
Smart Tab Manager: a program in Python that automates opening frequently used as well as specific, tailored websites with just one click. Instead of manually opening the same tabs every day, the program will launch all essential websites that you use almost every day (e.g, gmail, outlook, google classroom, PMT) instantly, however the primary feature enables the user to select modes such as "Study Mode," "Chill Mode", "Break Mode" etc. which will only open a certain assigned selection of websites and restrict the user from opening other specific websites (eg. restricts opening Netflix during study mode). It will also allow the user to input a time limit for which it will carry out the restrictions and once the time limit has ended the mode will also end and restrictions will be lifted.
